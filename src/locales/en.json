  "aboutUsContent": "We are a Mexican architecture workshop focused on generating meticulously designed projects that seek to improve the quality of life of our clients regardless of the scale of the projects. We believe that architecture and good design must be within everyone's reach. For us, the Taller DB project is a place to propose tangible solutions to the problems that we find in each place with each client, the quality of our work speaks for itself, and in each project we focus so that it is a reflection of the ideals that founded us as a firm, simultaneously being a reflection of the ideas and aspirations of our clients.",
